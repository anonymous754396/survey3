<h1>Subjective Evaluation of Audios</h1>
  
<h2>Dear users,</h2>
<h2>This website is about an audio-based project requiring your subjective opinion of audio files. We present a pair of audios at a time, and each pair corresponds to a question on the survey. The ID of audio pairs (i.e., "Q1" ) matches the "Q1" on the survey. You have to listen to a pair of audios and then answer the corresponding question on the survey. </h2> 
	
<h2> We highly appreciate your time and contribution to the out project! </h2> 
	
<h2> <FONT COLOR="red"> You only have one task: Provide your subjective opinions about if two speeches are from the same speaker based on the given audio pairs. (Some voices may occur multiple times, and the audio quality may vary. These phenomena are normal in the test.)  </FONT></h2>
